## The Goal

- For the library, we encourage you to discuss and contribute with new resources. For the existing ones, please note that our goal is to not have the biggest list of reousces. Our goal is to have most authentic resources.
- For the resources, please note that they are _highly opinionated_ and _curated_. Your opinion on the value of any resource may not match the opinion of the curator.

## Contributing

## Guidelines

- <p><strong>Adding everything available out there is not the goal!</strong><br /> 
  The idea is to have a library of psychedelic resources with most authentic and informative resources which can help genral user get sufficient knowledge about the current resource they are trying to access.</p>
- <p><strong>Do not add things you have not evaluated personally!</strong><br /> 
  Use your critical thinking to filter out non-essential stuff. Give honest arguments for why the resource should be included. Have you read this book? Can you give a short article? What does this particular resource link have which others don't.</p>
- <p><strong>One item per Pull Request</strong><br />
  There may be a discussion related to an item you want to add. Adding just a single item per pull request makes it much easier for everyone involved.</p>
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Look at the existing issues/pull requests before opening new ones
- One resource for one section, if you think their is a better alternative please state your reason and then open a pull request.
